This organisation *Coding for everyone* is for anyone who would like to learn to code and to do so in a collabortive environment.

We meet up regularly in the real world in London's East End. You can sign up for our next meetup via [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/).

Some of us are thinking of applying for the full-time coding course run by [Founders & Coders](http://foundersandcoders.org/). It is part of the application criteria that we should help others, so if you are a complete newbie, you should get plenty of help here.

Some of us are already at Founders & Coders. We help run the meetups and will try to answer any questions that you have that are not answered by the rest of the community.

So, if you have any questions, please follow the link to Gitter above.

All the best,

The Founders & Coders team.
